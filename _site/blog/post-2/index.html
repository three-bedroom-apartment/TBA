    <main> 
      <p>We sit down once a week<br>
Mostly Tuesdays but it doesn’t matter.<br>
We cut ourselfs off from the world for around 10 hours and just let it rip<br>
Like just whatever comes to mind is poured out<br>
It’s all sketches. The pen doesn’t stop moving<br>
It’s all stuff that’s been built up over the week. Release<br>
But it takes a while to get into it. A lot of bad things are synthesized but you can’t stop there<br>
Just keep doing more and more. Grind it out, see it through</p>
<p>Bad thing is most of the good stuff is impossible<br>
That’s how you know it’s good, when it’s not realistic. When it can't work, couldn’t possibly connect<br>
And that leads to whatever else needs to happen in the week<br>
Everything is based off that</p>
<p>Materials bought, substrates checked out, marks made. It’s about dissecting what’s going on<br>
Figuring out how these things could work, what it could be, the form of it. And what we learn in that<br>
Just loops back to the next Tuesday. And we take it from there</p>
