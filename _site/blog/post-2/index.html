      <h2>here is what happens</h2>
<p>We sit down once a week<br>
Mostly Tuesdays but it doesn’t matter.<br>
We cut ourselfs off from the world for around 10 hours and<br>
Like just whatever comes to mind is worked out<br>
It takes a while to get into. A lot of bad synthesis but you can’t stop there<br>
Just keep doing more and more. Grind it out, see it through</p>
<p>Bad thing is most of the good stuff is impossible<br>
That’s how you know it’s good, when it can't work like that, couldn’t possibly connect<br>
And that leads to whatever else needs to happen in the week<br>
Everything is based off that</p>
<p>Materials bought, substrates checked out, marks made. It’s about dissecting what’s going on<br>
Figuring out how these things could line up, what it could be, the sum of it. And what we learn from that<br>
Just loops back to next Tuesday. And we take it from there</p>
