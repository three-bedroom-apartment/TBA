We sit down once a week  
Mostly Tuesdays but it doesn’t matter.    
We cut ourselfs off from the world for around 10 hours and just  
Like just whatever comes to mind is poured out  
It’s all sketches. The pen doesn’t stop moving  
It’s all stuff that’s been building up over the week. Sewer  
It takes a while to get into. A lot of bad synthesis but you can’t stop there  
Just keep doing more and more. Grind it out, see it through

Bad thing is most of the good stuff is impossible  
That’s how you know it’s good, when it’s not realistic. When it can't work, couldn’t possibly connect   
And that leads to whatever else needs to happen in the week  
Everything is based off that

Materials bought, substrates checked out, marks made. It’s about dissecting what’s going on  
Figuring out how these things could line up, what it could be, the sum of it. And what we learn from that  
Just loops back to next Tuesday. And we take it from there
