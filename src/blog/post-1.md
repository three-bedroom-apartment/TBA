“Alas, here it goes!” said the mouse. “Don’t think. Trust your intuition.
No logical arguments, no rationalizing, no planning, no mockups,
and don’t compare options. The best advice I can give is to get going ASAP.
Make the first mark. Play. Explore. Experiment. React. Trust your feelings.
Trust your instincts. Trust your vision. It’s about sensibility. It’s about getting into it.
Let mistakes happen. Let things generate on their own. Find connections. It might look like art. Sometimes you get what you need.”

The grey ball of hair and teeth grew more and more excited as the tiny words left its tiny snout.

“Never expect or work towards a specific outcome,” said the mouse. “Take a Sunday drive approach. Seek forks in the road; that’s where you want to be. See where that takes you. Don’t make it difficult. Don’t let easy processes discourage you. Easy is good. Everything is easy nowadays. Difficult doesn’t mean good. Complicated doesn’tmean good. Easy is what you want. Don’t try too hard. Embrace uncertainty.
Do the opposite. Don’t force it. Start with the bad and go from there,” said the mouse. “Shy away from dogma. Don’t make sense. Keep it obscure, weird, and illegible.Not worrying about meaning is usually a good start. Take something and add to it. Take something and remove from it. Aim for ambivalence. Ambivalence is good. Lean into it. Ambivalence gives you a chance to figure it out, or figure yourself out, maybe your relation to it. What I’m saying is, make stuff that you have a hard time understanding yourself. Keep it interesting.”

The small rodent was barely enough weight for the floorboards to notice.

“Hunt for processes and materials,” said the mouse. “Create your own. Steal from everywhere. Form a line. Keep things flowing. Don’t let ambitions slow you down. Work within your means. Start small and go big. Make studies and scale up later. Only serialize when necessary. Try a lot of things. Don’t limit yourself. Do whatever you want. Don’t strive for perfection. Avoid getting stuck. If you get stuck, work on something else. You don’t need to finish everything; just leave it open.Don’t overthink it. It’s just work. Create and move on. Document the good, discard the rest.”

The mouse paused for a moment to contemplate all this. Something was still missing.
“Trends pass,” the mouse said slowly. “Be cautious of pop culture and mass media. It’s hard to pull off and doesn’t age well.”This was true at present, but would it always be the case? Would pop culture and mass media even continue to exist?

“What I’m trying to say is, reflect on your consumption,” the mouse added, aiming to future-proof its argument. “Whatever you put in will, to some extent, come out. Avoid being cringe. Feel it out. Go for timeless.”

“Right, right,” said the cat, leaning back.
